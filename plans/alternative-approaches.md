## Recommendation for Grid Platform

Based on the PRD and requirements, I recommend:

**Primary Approach**: **API-First Development** with **Cloud-Native** patterns
**Secondary Approach**: **TDD** for critical components
**Community Approach**: **Open Source** for documentation and examples

### Rationale
1. **API-First**: Grid is an infrastructure platform that needs multiple clients (web, CLI, operator)
2. **Cloud-Native**: Grid needs to scale and work across multiple cloud providers
3. **TDD**: Infrastructure management requires high reliability and quality
4. **Open Source**: Community adoption is a key success metric

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Start with 2-Week PoC** using API-first approach
2. **Build core API** with comprehensive testing
3. **Add cloud-native patterns** as we scale
4. **Open source documentation** to build community
5. **Iterate based on feedback** and community needs
