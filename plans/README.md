- **Standards:** Code quality, testing, security, documentation
- **Processes:** Git workflow, PR process, release process, monitoring

### 6. [Success Metrics & KPIs](./success-metrics-kpis.md)
**Goal:** Define measurable success criteria and key performance indicators
- **Categories:** Development, Business, Technical, Product metrics
- **Phases:** PoC, MVP, Full Platform success criteria
- **Measurement:** Automated and manual data collection, reporting, analysis

### 7. [Risk Management](./risk-management.md)
**Goal:** Identify, assess, and mitigate risks throughout development
- **Categories:** Technical, Business, Operational, Security risks
- **Assessment:** Risk severity and probability matrix
- **Mitigation:** Specific strategies for each risk category
